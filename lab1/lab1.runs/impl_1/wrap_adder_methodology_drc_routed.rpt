TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.406 ns between rCnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and rResult_reg[49]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
